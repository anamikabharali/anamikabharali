"Life is a climb, but the view is great!"

Iâ€™m an engineer at heart: I hate fixing the same problem twice and will happily spend extra time to fix it well once. 
<br> Future entrepreneur - naturally, I love studying businesses and what drives them. <br>
In love with experimentation â€” whether itâ€™s with data, ideas, or biohacking solutions.<br> 
Type A, a bit neurotic <br>
