## Hellowww!

Type A, a bit neurotic, fast-paced  <br>
In love with experimentation — whether it’s with data, ideas, or biohacking solutions.<br> 
I’m an engineer at heart: I hate fixing the same problem twice and will happily spend extra time to fix it well once. 
<br>I love studying businesses and what drives them. <br>
