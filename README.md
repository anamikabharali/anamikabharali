## Hellowww!

"Life is a climb, but the view is great!"

Iâ€™m an engineer at heart: I hate fixing the same problem twice and will happily spend extra time upfront to make sure a solution is robust. Future entrepreneur - naturally I love studying businesses and what drives them. 
In love with experimentation â€” whether itâ€™s with data, ideas, or biohacking solutions. 
Type A, a bit neurotic about knowing everything because I hate being half-aware.
